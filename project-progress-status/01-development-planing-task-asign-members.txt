Subject: 🚀 Corexfin Project Architecture Kickoff

Good Morning Corexfin Team!

I hope you're all doing well.

As we move forward with the Corexfin project, I’d like to share a high-level breakdown of our architecture to ensure clarity and alignment across teams. The project is divided into two main parts: Administration and Customer Services, each with dedicated microservices.

🛠️ Administration Services (Internal Operations)
These six services will handle the core backend functionalities:

corexfin-admin – Admin panel and operational controls
corexfin-auth – Authentication and authorization
corexfin-user – User profile and management
corexfin-account – Account creation and maintenance
corexfin-transaction – Transaction processing and history
corexfin-notification – Email, SMS, and in-app notifications
🌐 Customer Services (User-Facing)
This service will power the customer experience:

corexfin-internet-banking – Secure and intuitive online banking interface
This modular approach will help us maintain scalability, improve maintainability, and ensure clear ownership of each service. Let’s collaborate closely to make Corexfin a robust and seamless financial platform.

Feel free to reach out with any questions or suggestions. Looking forward to building something great together!

Best regards,
Brijesh Nishad

✅ Corexfin-Admin Service Kickoff Plan
🔹 Purpose
The corexfin-admin service will serve as the central control panel for managing users, accounts, transactions, and system configurations. It will be used by internal staff and administrators.



```

```
🎯 Current Focus: corexfin-admin
To streamline development and collaboration, we will all start working together on the corexfin-admin service. This will help us establish the foundation for admin operations, set up shared components, and define standards for the rest of the services.

Let’s ensure:

Clear communication on tasks and responsibilities
Consistent coding practices and documentation
Regular sync-ups to track progress and resolve blockers
Looking forward to building something impactful together. Let’s make Corexfin a success!

Best regards
